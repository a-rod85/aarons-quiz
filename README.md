## Introduction


I wanted to do a quiz, based on different subjects. We all believe we have alot of knowledge
on anything and everything (including myslef). So why not create a game based on true or
false on different subjects.

## Project Goals



My goal for the site is to create a user friendly site for everybody who enjoys testing 
their knowledge on different topics. 
As mentioned its based on True or Flase each correct answer you will earn points based on
the difficulty level; easy = 25, medium = 50 & hard=100 points.

## Site Owner Goals

⊛ Have fun
⊛ User will want to get a top score
⊛ User will want to test themsleves with what they think they know
⊛ User will want to test themselves against friends and see who's better

## User Goals

⊛Improve each time they play
⊛Have fun
⊛Improve their knowledge
⊛Will want to get as many questions correct

## User Stories


⊛As a site user I can see the title of the subjects in question ie. film, books

⊛As a site user I can click on the subject of choice

⊛As a site user I can click on wether I wish to have an easy, medium or hard question (should by the card points number)

⊛As a site user I can chose true or false for my answer

⊛As a site user it will be visable if the answer is correct or incorrect

⊛As I site user it's visable to see your total score during and after the quiz is finished


## Design Goals

⊛ A site that works on all devices.

⊛ Clean and Simple design.

⊛ Easy to understand and use.

⊛ Questions are clear and easy to read

⊛ Question cards are responsive



## Design Choices

⊛Font

As Font I chose Roboto-Slab, 
I chose this as it reminds me of the game jeapody which was a popular quiz show on TV. 
Wanted the user (if they have watched it ) to have the same feeling.
